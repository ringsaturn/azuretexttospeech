# AzureTextToSpeech Client #

This package provides a client for Azure's Cognitive Services (speech services) Text To Speech API. Users of the client
can specify the lanaguage (`Region` type), a string containing the desired text to speak as well as the gender (`Gender` type) in which the audiofile should be rendered. The library fetches the audio rendered in the format of your choice (see `AudioOutput` types for supported formats).

The following will synthesize the string `64 BASIC BYTES FREE. READY.`, using the en-US locale, rending with a female voice. The output file format is a 16khz 32kbit single channel MP3 audio file.

```golang
import tts "github.com/ringsaturn/azuretexttospeech"
func main() {
    # See TextToSpeechAPI and TokenRefreshAPI types for list of endpoints and regions.
    azureSpeech, _ := tts.New("YOUR-API-KEY", tts.RegionEastUS)
    ctx := context.Background()
    payload, _ := az.SynthesizeWithContext(
        ctx,
        "64 BASIC BYTES FREE. READY.",
        tts.LocaleEnUS,                  // Region type
        tts.GenderFemale,                // Gender type
        tts.Audio16khz32kbitrateMonoMp3) // AudioOutput type
    // the response `payload` is your byte array containing audio data.
}
```
